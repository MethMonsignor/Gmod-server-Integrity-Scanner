Diagnostic Suite – Security & Ethical Use Policy

These scripts are designed for educational and administrative use only. They are not intended for automated bans, public shaming, or unauthorized surveillance.

Responsible Use
Use the scanner to audit your own server or addons under review

Do not use flagged results to accuse authors without manual verification

Always disclose findings privately and respectfully if contacting addon creators

False Positives
Many flagged patterns are benign in context

Obfuscation, networking, and serialization may be legitimate

Treat all results as indicators—not proof of malicious intent

Prohibited Uses
Public blacklists based solely on scan results

Automated punishment systems without human review

Uploading flagged addons to this repository or elsewhere

Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a vulnerability in the scanner itself, please report it via GitHub Issues or contact the Lore Council directly. Do not disclose exploits publicly until they are patched.

Licensing & Attribution
This project is governed by the MIT License with lore attribution. All contributions must respect authorship, transparency, and ethical modding practices.
